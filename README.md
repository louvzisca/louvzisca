I want to shazam a 100 songs played in aruba. I will pick five places where I will shazam about a 20 songs. 

The places will be a hotel lobby, a gym, a chique restaurant, a ‘young and fun’ restaurant and a bar. Aruba is a country with a lot of immigrants, a lot of different cultures and a lot of different influences. 

The research is about the geographic region, where does the music come from. Also is it about wether the language of the song is multiligiual, the language of the country, or a language of a different country.

The music will be compared. Is there a certain bpm that we hear a lot. Is there a certain length of the music that is popular. How popular are the songs at which parts of the world, are they playing a lot of pop musics of many places or are there more hidden songs that are played in aruba a lot.  

There will be an overview of the genres, and also will be seen the overlap in the genres of the different places. Hispanic music, brazillian, American and Dutch. All will be part of the findings. 

I do however right now have some doubts regarding that the topic question is too big and it would be more valuable to go more in depth about a more specific music genre.
